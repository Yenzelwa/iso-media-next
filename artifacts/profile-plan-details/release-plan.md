Title: Release Plan — Profile – Plan Details

Exposure
- UI improvements to profile Plan Details modals; no API changes.

Validation
- Manual check on Profile > Plan Details: open each modal; verify center, focus, ESC, and scroll lock.
- Run unit tests and visual checks (optional baseline refresh).

Rollback
- Revert commit if regressions observed. Low risk.
