# Release Plan – Browse Page Epic

## Rollout
- Deploy to staging behind existing browse feature scope.
- Verify hero/carousel behavior with fresh content seeds.
- Confirm footer alignment across breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile).

## Observability
- Manual QA to confirm no console errors; monitor existing frontend logs for fetch failures.
- No new metrics; rely on existing browser error tracking.

## Rollback
- Revert PR if regressions detected; Hero/Carousel components still backward compatible.
- Reintroduce previous browse page styling from Git history if necessary.

## Post-Deploy
- Capture final "after" screenshots for documentation.
- Gather feedback from design on hero parity.
